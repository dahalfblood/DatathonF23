Red questions:

#1 17604
#2 17616 This number does not coincide with the number given by Excel. This is because of file headers etc
#3 cp-1252 is needed for us based data becuase it is the legacy standard 
    and without specificying it will be treated as utf-8 and decoding will fail
#4 18843 it doesnt match because listing every district is a huge task and im sure small tiny disctricts can 
    be forgoteen about etc depending on the rigor of the agency gathering data
#5 I trust the EDGE data more because there are more lines per taylor woodard
